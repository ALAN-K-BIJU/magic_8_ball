# 🎱 Magic 8 Ball – Predictive Answer Generator

**Magic 8 Ball** is a fun, interactive Flutter app that answers life's toughest questions with a simple button press. This project reinforces the fundamental Flutter concepts I practiced in the Dicee app—particularly the use of `StatefulWidget`, `setState()`, and dynamic UI behavior.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to deepen my understanding of Flutter’s widget system, especially focusing on how state is managed and updated in response to user interaction.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- A dynamic 8 Ball image that changes randomly on interaction  
- Simulates a prediction generator with multiple possible outcomes  
- Simple and clean UI designed using core Flutter widgets  
- Button interaction using gesture detection and state management

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- ✨ Working with **Stateful Widgets** to update UI on user input
- 🔄 Using `setState()` to trigger UI refresh and reflect state changes
- 🧱 Understanding widget tree structure and how to build layouts with `Column` and `Expanded`
- 🔢 Implementing random number generation to select different images (answers)
- 📦 Structuring a small yet functional Flutter app
